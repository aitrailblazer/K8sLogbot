            **Analysis Results:**
            - **Warnings Detected:**
              - At 12:32:00Z, a performance bottleneck was noted with database queries.
              - Memory usage warning at 12:45:00Z indicating potential for OutOfMemory errors.
              - Network retry warning at 13:05:00Z due to temporary issues.

            - **Errors Found:**
              - Connection to external service failed at 12:33:00Z.
              - An OutOfMemoryError occurred at 12:50:00Z during job processing.

            - **Info Logs:**
              - Application startup and normal operations were logged.

            **Recommendations:**
            - Investigate the database query performance issue.
            - Review the application's memory usage and consider increasing resource limits or optimizing memory usage.
            - Check configurations for external service connections and implement retry logic with backoff.
            - Monitor network stability and consider implementing circuit breaker patterns for network-related operations.`;
